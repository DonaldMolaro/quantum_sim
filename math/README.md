# Math Helpers

This folder contains small, focused utilities used by the simulator and algorithms.

- `bit_ops.hh/.cc`: bit extraction and replacement helpers for register slices.
- `mod_arith.hh/.cc`: modular arithmetic helpers (e.g., `mod_pow`, `gcd`).
- `qft_utils.hh`: QFT guardrails and phase computation helpers.
- `register_layout.hh`: common register layout helpers for algorithms (e.g., Shor).
